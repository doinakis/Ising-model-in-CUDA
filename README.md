## Project as part of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki assignment.
### How to run the code
In order to run the code with the included tester just cd in either the cuda or sequential directory
and type make. Then you can run it by typing ./main_cuda_v1, ./main_cuda_v2, ./main_cuda_v3 or
./main_sequential, depending on which version you want to test.
